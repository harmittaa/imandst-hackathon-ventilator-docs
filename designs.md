### E-19 Ventilator
The E-19 is a unique design so information cannot be found in other media. Likewise, it has not been previously manufactured or put into operation in health institutions. The E-19 has an evaluation and validation by the Hackathon jury called: Hack the pandemic. The purpose of the hackathon is to provide alternative solutions to an open-source source in order to reduce the impact of Covid-19 on health institutions.

Submitted in issue [5](https://github.com/harmittaa/imandst-hackathon-ventilator-docs/issues/7).
