### E-19 Ventilator
The E-19 is a unique design so information cannot be found in other media. Likewise, it has not been previously manufactured or put into operation in health institutions. The E-19 has an evaluation and validation by the Hackathon jury called: Hack the pandemic. The purpose of the hackathon is to provide alternative solutions to an open-source source in order to reduce the impact of Covid-19 on health institutions.

Submitted in issue [7](https://github.com/harmittaa/imandst-hackathon-ventilator-docs/issues/7).

### Modified Open Lung User interface
After thorough research on ventilator protoypes, open source initiatives, etc., we found a great initiative named Open Lung, based in Toronto, Canada. Using innovation methodologies, we found an area of opportunity in the design, so we suggest to add pre-set user profiles in order to facilitate the use, especially in emergency situations.

### The Uncritical Ventilator
Ventilator using fan from CPAP machine
Submitted in issue [9](https://github.com/harmittaa/imandst-hackathon-ventilator-docs/issues/9).


__Link__: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JqkY3SXch_tlAmNuQfZxYzvYZpKKcbOLVqxGSsjuPKI/edit?usp=sharing The last slide of the presentation has some documentation, information about Barotrauma and other issues with ongoing low-cost ventilator designs:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vLPefHYWpY

__Build instructions__: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n57u1NvXBgw

__Inspired by__: https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator

__Built__: No

__Is it in use__: No

__Has it been validated__: The original design has entries from professionals, (see original design link for more info)

__(Estimated) cost of the build__: $3,000 MXN

__(Estimated) time it takes to build__: Around 5 hours, including code but if we were to introduce the necessary sensors and code them it would most likely take more time (for the first ventilator at least), then it would take less time to reproduce since the code con just be replicated to all.


__Can the parts be sourced locally__: Yes

* __Parts__:
    * CPAP/12V inflator pump
    * Arduino
    * Brushless DC motor electronic speed controller (10A min)
    * Input controller
    * Power supply
    * Tubing and face mask
    * optional battery backup

* **List of required tools**:
    * Arduino software
    * 3D printer, if you have no face mask to attach

__What is special about this design__: It's low cost and programmable, it's also compatible with existing equipment

__What help do you need with the design:__ To know wether it could be used in hospitals for first response in patients or to transition from a fancy hospital-grade ventilator to no ventilator at all.

__Other notes:__
* We know that it's no match for a professional ventilator but we hope that it could help inane way or another to combat the breathing difficulties of patients who:
    * have no professional ventilator available
    * could use some breathing aid without being in a critical state (hence the name)
    * are in the process of losing the tubes

### AMBU4ALL
By having two ambu bags you get a better use of resources, the motor rotates at 12 rpm generating a cycle time of 5s. Bases can be adjusted every 5 mm, providing versatility in volumetric air adjustment.
