This page lists open source ventilator designs provided through [the issue system](https://github.com/harmittaa/imandst-hackathon-ventilator-docs/issues/3).

Not all designs might have been added yet, but they can be found from the [issues list](https://github.com/harmittaa/imandst-hackathon-ventilator-docs/issues)

### Simple Oxygen (inspired by OxyGEN respirator)
Due to the use of a windscreen wiper motor the design can be powered by a car battery and is therefore portable

### E-19 Ventilator
The E-19 is a unique design so information cannot be found in other media. Likewise, it has not been previously manufactured or put into operation in health institutions. The E-19 has an evaluation and validation by the Hackathon jury called: Hack the pandemic. The purpose of the hackathon is to provide alternative solutions to an open-source source in order to reduce the impact of Covid-19 on health institutions.

Submitted in issue [7](https://github.com/harmittaa/imandst-hackathon-ventilator-docs/issues/7).

### Modified Open Lung User interface
After thorough research on ventilator protoypes, open source initiatives, etc., we found a great initiative named Open Lung, based in Toronto, Canada. Using innovation methodologies, we found an area of opportunity in the design, so we suggest to add pre-set user profiles in order to facilitate the use, especially in emergency situations.
